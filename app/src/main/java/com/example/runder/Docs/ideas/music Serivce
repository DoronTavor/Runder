The idea is like that:
because all the app is in the concept of "community", the music should be also.
So, When clicking in the music button in the main activity/managing group activity,
you will see all of the songs that the community ADDED to the DataBase,or he can add his song(Enter the song's name, song's artist and link from youtube/ Spotify).
When a song is clicked, the link of the song will be downloaded to the app via service, and then the song will be downloaded.
the user can download many songs in one time, but the songs will be played in the order he pressed.

The Firebase's music child will look like that- for example
"Music":{
    "Song One":{
        "Name" : "Don't Speak",
        "Artist": "No Doubt",
        "Link" : "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR3Vdo5etCQ"
    }
