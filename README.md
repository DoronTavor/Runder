# Runder
Runder is a community running app. this app helps you to find someone to run with in your area that fit to your running attributes. this app is based on Google FireBase realTime Database.
the app is for android users only, and also it feets perffectly only for phones with the size of pixel 4xl or bigger. 
Main Technologies of the App:
  1. Google SignIn- if you want to use the app via emulator, it may creates some problems, check it.
  2. Google Maps- The app uses the SDK of the google maps, please change to your API Token- because i dont want to have a lot of transactions for my token.
  3. Twilio API- I'm not using the SDK of twilio for a number of reasons. PLEASE change to your API token and key because my account is in trial mode, and it allowes me to send messages only for limited numbers.
  4. Android GPS- If you are using the app with an emulator you will need to change the location in the emulator's settings.
